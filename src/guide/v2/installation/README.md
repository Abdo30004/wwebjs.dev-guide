# Installing Node

Before you can start working you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and whatsapp-web.js first.

whatsapp-web.js `v2` is requring Node v12 or higher else you can not use it.

::: tip
To check if you already have Node installed on your machine, run `node -v` in your [terminal](/guide/v2/popular-topics/guide-explanations/). If the output is `v12` or higher, then you're good to go! Otherwise you should continue reading this.

## Installation on Windows

On Windows, it's as simple as installing any other program. Download the latest version from [the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/), open the downloaded file, and follow the steps from the installer.

## Installation on macOS

On macOS, either:

- Download the latest version from [the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/), open the package installer, and follow the instructions
- Use a package manager like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with the command `brew install node`


If you're developing on macOS, you have a few options. You can go to the Node.js website (opens new window), download the latest version, double click the package installer, and follow the instructions. Or you can use a package manager like Homebrew (opens new window)with the command brew install node.
## Installation on Linux

On Linux, you can consult [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to determine how you should install Node.

If you're developing on Linux, you may consult this page (opens new window)to determine how you should install Node.
On that note, there's a possibility that you may already have Node (e.g., if you're using a VPS). You can check by running the node -v command. If it outputs something like v12.0 or higher, then you're good to go! Otherwise, take a look at the page linked above for instructions on installing Node on your OS.
