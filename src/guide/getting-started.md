# Getting Started

:::warning
The whatsapp-web.js guide is still a work in progress, which means there may be bugs. If this happens, please create an [issue on github](https://github.com/wwebjs/wwebjs.dev/issues/new). To learn about all the features available to you in the library, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.wwebjs.dev/).

## Installation

Before you can work with whatsapp-web.js you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and whatsapp-web.js first.

### Installing Node

whatsapp-web.js v2 requires Node v12 or higher.

::: tip
To check if you already have Node installed on your machine, run `node -v` in your terminal. If it outputs `v12` or higher, then you're good to go! Otherwise, continue reading.

On Windows, it's as simple as installing any other program. Download the latest version from [the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/), open the downloaded file, and follow the steps from the installer.

On macOS, either:

- Download the latest version from [the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/), open the package installer, and follow the instructions
- Use a package manager like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with the command `brew install node`

On Linux, you can consult [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to determine how you should install Node.
